# Python Hacker Statistics Script

## Description

This Python program uses a 'hacker statistics' approach to calculate the odds of climbing a staircase and reaching at least step 60, when the numbers of steps you go up and down is dictated by dice rolls.

Starting at Step 0...

- If you roll a 3, 4 or 5 you go up one step
- If you roll a 1, 2 or 3 you go down one step
- If you roll a 6, you roll the die again and go up the number of steps shown
- On every roll, there is a 0.5% chance you'll trip and fall to the bottom

The resulting probability is calculated from a number of simulations (initially 500), displayed as a histogram and returned as a percentage.
